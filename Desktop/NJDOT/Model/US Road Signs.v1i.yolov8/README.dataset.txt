Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Automatic Driving Assistance: This model could be implemented in cars to assist with automatic driving features. The system would detect and decipher road signs to guide decisions such as stopping, altering speed, or obeying specified restrictions.

2. Road Maintenance Monitoring: Government or local authorities can use this model to automatically survey road signs, identify those that are worn out, damaged, blocked, or missing, helping to prioritize maintenance tasks.

3. Interactive Maps and Navigation Apps: This model could be used to update and enhance detailing on interactive maps such as Google Street View or GPS navigation apps by detecting and labeling road signs.

4. Road Safety Education: The model could be integrated into driving training and testing applications to educate new drivers about different road signs and what they represent in a controlled and repeatable digital environment.

5. Traffic Flow Analysis: The model can be used in conjunction with CCTV or drone footage to monitor and analyze traffic compliance with specific road signs, contributing to traffic management and city planning strategies.
